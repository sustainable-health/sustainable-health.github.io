<p>We have a sacred obligation to build a new society, a new civilization for future generations. Each one of us has a specific role to play in this revolution that we have instigated by creating climate changing conditions. For me that sacred obligation is to inspire a cadre of Sustainable Health Practitioners who can deliver culturally sensitive health care and contribute to building a Cultural Library of Sustainable Health Resources.</p>
<p id="about-strong1">
<strong>Medicine comes in many forms. It is in stories, in song and in touch. It is in connection, communication and relationship. Sustainable Health withstands the tests of time. It is human. We have forgotten that we know it. We are here now to remember.</strong>
</p>
<p>Healing wisdom is in the cells of our bodies. We can awaken to it when we are together. The research we need to do involves collecting the sustainable, including indigenous, medicines that already exist. This includes touch therapies, herbal and plant medicines, healing songs and stories, and related traditional and innovative healing arts that can be transmitted. Folk remedies and modern clinically tested alternative interventions, such as some applied touch therapies, are examples. This research will be collated in a Cultural Library of Sustainable Health Resources. The Cultural Library has already been constructed digitally and is being developed now through the TARA Approach for the Resolution of Shock and Trauma (<a href="https://www.tara-approach.org/">www.Tara-Approach.org</a>) in collaboration with Climate Change &amp; Consciousness (<a href="https://www.cccearth.org/">www.cccearth.org</a>).</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Cultural Sensitivity;</li>
<li>Empowerment Based;</li>
<li>Easily Taught and Replicated;</li>
<li>Translates to All Demographics;</li>
<li>Has Been Tested by Time And/Or Clinical Trials;</li>
<li>Is Non-Invasive;</li>
<li>Has a Potent, Undiluted Self-Care Aspect;</li>
<li>Evokes the Natural Healing Response;</li>
<li>Is Not Traumatizing;</li>
<li>Is Repeatable by Anyone, Regardless of Circumstances;</li>
<li>Can be Shared Readily, to Others; and</li>
<li>Provides Relief from Chronic and Acute Conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sustainable Health brings us out of the cocoon of privileged and expensive dependency on cost-prohibitive and authoritarian healthcare delivery. It awakens healing capacities we may not have known that we had.  It is sensitive to vulnerabilities and honors them. It is both individually and community oriented.</p>
</div>
<div id="about-col-3" class="col-md-4">
<h4 id="sustainable-health-is-the-new-story">SUSTAINABLE HEALTH IS THE NEW STORY</h4>
<p>To practice Sustainable Health we have to discard false beliefs such as those that discredit human intuition. We must listen to inner directives, dreams and personal insights, and not discredit or patronize authentic knowing. Sustainable Health humanizes healthcare delivery. It restores and evoke the inherent healing wisdom of communities. It honors lineages of healing wisdom. It does not, however, discredit Western science or allopathy. It is a fusion, whenever possible and whenever needed. It is a synthesis. It aims to put the wellbeing of the recipient, the one in need or the community in need, at the center of all interventions.</p>
<p>A revolution in healthcare has long been needed and climate change is making that possible. This revolution goes hand in hand with the revolutions in food and water sourcing, energy use, climate justice and economics. It is fueled by the evolution in consciousness that is kindled by these times. Sustainable Health is responsible; it is responsible for individual and collective wellbeing. Nothing is more fundamental for thriving in a climate changing world than health. We have the capacity to be healthy even as conditions change dramatically and we are faced with unprecedented health challenges in all aspects of life. In fact, Sustainable Health suggests an entirely new definition of health as resiliency.</p>
<p>Sustainable Health is possible for every age and every human condition. It is intended to provide resources for the very beginning and the very end of life. We have the agency to create this revolution in healthcare. In fact, I would say that many of us were born to do this.</p>
